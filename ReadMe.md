## CreateMask
This software lets you create a mask for a 3D UV resin printer that uses DLP technique.
A mask is used to have homogeneous light intensity across the build area. 
When you want to print objects that cover quiet some surface of the build area, you
definitely want to use a good mask to prevent under and over exposure of the layers.

This is a GUI(WPF)/Console Windows application build in C# on .Net 4.6
